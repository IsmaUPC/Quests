## Quests and Missions design


Hello,I’m Ismael Tejada, a student of the degree in Videogame Design and Development at the UPC through the [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/cat/), and today I will explain a little about the design of these two points. The content of this web page has been developed as part of Project 2 of the second year subject, under the supervision of [Ramon Santamaria](https://es.linkedin.com/in/raysan).


## What a mission is?
   ![Image](/Assets/mission.jpg)

First of all I will define the word mission according to the Cambridge dictionary "a prolonged search for something that is difficult to find or an attempt to achieve something difficult." The clear definition of causality.

But ... how should they be approached from the point of view of a video game designer? And what do they mean for the players?

Well, we can say that mission design is part of the heart of our game, since it brings together 3 very important aspects, such as level design, the mechanics that are used and most importantly, the narrative.

   ![Image](/Assets/grafic_quest_and_missions.jpg)

Quoting Philippe Bergeron “Iterating the ideas of the designer alongside those of the writer. This is where most of the hours are spent for a good design".

That is why this part is of vital importance for game developers / designers since the player could forgive the graphics or certain mechanics, but not a repetitive and tedious narrative in a game in which the mechanics are 10 but the missions are the same over and over again creating repetitive routines in which the player ends up not spending time on them. 

When we talk about quests from a point of view closer to that of a player, it is when we see that our character has an objective to fulfill either because it is part of the story or because it has been entrusted to him.

There are many types of missions and of different importance. There are the main ones, which we normally associate with the story mode, some that have to do with the main narrative in a secondary way or not directly related.

But returning to the designer's point of view, it is remarkable that over time, both our video games and the way we see them have evolved.
At the same time, the missions have also followed the same path, with the appearance of new genres such as sandbox games, platforms, MMOs ... plus each genre is different, we cannot expect the same from all of them. With so many changes and so many possibilities, how do we know the best way to design our missions?

In this brief analysis I will provide you with different guidelines and tools that can help you. I will put several examples of good and bad praxis, obviously we will see games like Skyrim, the witcher 3 or wow in these comparisons. 


## Mission Types

If we look closely at the missions of all the games, we can see that there are a varied number of types among them.
I will talk about the following 4 types:

Murder
Looking for / giving someone / something
Gather Items
Escort someone

These are the types that most often abound in games. Surely a game with a mission within these 4 types is coming to mind. Although it is true that point 2 could be divided into search and delivery, I have decided to put them together given the similarities in terms of objectives, but we will go deeper later.

 But to quote James from extra-credits "Why are there almost 5 types of missions?" "Because many designers conceptualize their games as only combat or tour"

It is because many designers just try to turn them into combat or displacement and with those only two axes, the options are limited. They use them to "guide" the player to where they think he should go, as a way of teaching him to use that incredible charged attack he just learned, or to find the next important area.

The player is "forced" to do what we think is right, rather than letting him participate himself.
So .. Is this really a good structure to follow for our design?


## How to properly create a Quest

Lately the trend when developing video games is to try to make the player feel free and have the feeling of writing his own story, because the feeling of choosing gives them satisfaction, since they are not weighed down by a fixed script, at least not 100%. %.

The first step in creating a quest is to pose a problem to the player, but this must be attractive, first providing a call with a brushstroke of information, from a letter on a table that shines to a lady asking for help.
Whether this element is object or person, when it is interacted with the player, it must give the player an idea of what they are going to face, giving the player room to decide whether to accept the quest or not.

Advising the player and giving him an idea about what his actions can do, influences decision-making and will give him a better sense of immersion.

### How to guide the player, without him noticing
   ![Image](/Assets/guide_player.gif)

It is true that we want to convey a sense of freedom to the player, but at the same time we do not want him to lose himself, but we cannot take him by the hand and stop treating him as a rational being, so you have to find a balance.
The player will be guided based on the key concepts of the mission, an object to carry, a person to protect or a puzzle to solve. The clues that we want the player to follow must be "subtle" but findable and easy to follow once understood. Let the interest flow not only from the reward, but from the sense of adventure.

### Make your world alive.

Each quest must be given a background, a story, or a twist that makes it interesting and has a real reason for existence. You have to take a very important object to a site B, well, okay, but have it stolen in the middle of the road, or tried, or a strange being appears to help me complete the task and provide me with important information along the way. about where I am, or about an important subplot.

People love to be told stories and more if they are interesting. It does not matter if there is a choice, because there is no wrong decision, the important thing is that that story exists and that you do not feel that you are locked in a box, but that you are in an environment that lives and breathes by itself.


### Reinforce the main narrative and game pillars

When we create a quest and we want to weave a narrative, it must fit and reinforce some of the fundamental pillars of our game, so if magic or unicorns or aliens exist in our world, it will be normal for us to be told stories about invasions aliens, or how Fred once saw a unicorn and no one believed him and you must help him find it.

Briefly said, make everything in cohesion with the world that we have created for the player and help make the main argument more credible and important. 


## The 4X’s of Hayashida’s design
 ![Image](/Assets/si_wiiu_super_mario3d_world.jpg)
 
Koichi Hayashida, lead designer of the latest 3D Mario games, defined his work philosophy with 4 concepts that together strengthen the design of Nintendo games.

+ Explore the world:
Give the player the ability to move around the world to adopt a specific orientation of how to play

+ Expand the area to discover
Give the player a space to test what they learn without being penalized by failure, a safe testing environment where they can begin to master the mechanics.

+ Exploit the mechanics:
Once the player has mastered and internalized the mechanics, we must give importance to the decisions that the player makes when using the mechanics, leave him out of the safe space and face the danger so that he uses what he has learned against him.

+ Exterminate:
Pose a challenge that tests everything at once as part of the end of the process, if the player has learned well, he will be rewarded for his own learning and will want more. 


+ Quest vs Mission
Officially, according to the Cambridge Dictionary, a quest is "a long search for something that is difficult to find, or an attempt to achieve something difficult"

But well, what is the difference between what we call a quest in design and what is a mission?

We define a Quest as a difficult or greater objective, if we analyze it carefully from the point of view of video games. There are two main structures, one that follows the description and one that does not, this is where we see the difference.

For example, let's see the quest as a crusade that our protagonist faces, with a much more narrative central structure. Instead, the mission can be done more similar to a task, something that the protagonist must do, for example an NPC asks you to do something and consequently he rewards you. This can be seen involved in a Quest, being part of it or not. 

With this in mind, we could associate Quests with crusades and missions with something more like a task. 


## Guiding player’s attention

While designing a mission we have to take into account that we are creating an experience. For this we must take into account certain psychological factors that will help us create a better experience for our player.

This is where we will talk about how to properly capture his attention. 

This is why we must talk about some human and psychological behaviors that can help us create this content.

We will analyze from a point closer to our player.
What is it that makes our player interested in missions and have a desire for more?
One of our tasks as designers is to satisfy with quality experiences, but how do you make them want a new experience or how do you exploit those needs in a crafty way?

If our goal is to create a complete Quest, we may have some behavioral guidelines that most people follow.

**Illusion of power:**
Giving you the freedom to choose different options during the Quest can help us convey the feeling that the player is making relevant decisions. We will also get him to get more involved in the plot due to the consequences of his actions. thus creating a positive experience that facilitates the transmission of that illusion of power.

Since if you satisfy these three basic needs:

- Free will
- Deal with the consequences of your actions
- Situations close to reality.

This will provide a much more satisfying experience.

**Collectionism:**
This section is very important if you consider Achiever type players. Surely you are a connoisseur of video games that exploit the feature of completing collections, such as the kolog seeds in "Zelda Breath of The Wild" or the stars in "Mario Odyssey".

This takes advantage of one of the basic human instincts, inherited from our ancestors who walked while discovering and collecting new resources, a habit that over the years created this instinct to take or possess something.

The satisfaction that human beings feel when completing a collection, seeing all its parts together and feeling that it has been completed, is the satisfaction that we will take advantage of.

**The need to finish what was started:**
As a human being, it is not usually pleasant to leave things in the middle of the process, we usually feel the feeling of having to finish what we started. This takes advantage of the feeling of responsibility and the ego of our player.  


## Receiving Quests
![Image](/Assets/reciving_mission.jpg)
_"The Elder Scrolls Skyrim"_

The quality standards for how we make the player receive a mission can go beyond putting exclamation marks on the head of each NPC who wants to say something to us.

We must ensure that the characters generate interest on their own, either by their actions or their clothes, the objects they carry, or because they directly address us and open a dialog box without asking, although we can later reject the quest.

We can guide the player to an isolated object in an area with a lot of space, we can make a poster on a wall have true readability when interacting with it.

We must make these elements that are going to potentially lead us to temporarily focus on a narrative arc other than the main one, are sufficiently integrated into the world to have coherence within the scene, but are enough visible and attractive for us to take a look at them.

To manage all these events we can provide the player with a menu of quests, usually in the form of a list in a notebook, indicating the distance to the objective or the key concept of this without saturating the player with information.

Or we can also limit the number of active quests and that the player can resort to backtracking when finishing one to start another.

The more organic the approach, the better it is for the player. 


### What should we avoid

In the field of game design, there are several generic cases / stereotypes, which we must try to avoid at all costs. Although sometimes there is no choice but to use one.

 + Christmas lights:
This is the kind of case where the map becomes cluttered with items that point you to many quests in different locations. Anything that is generating saturation for the player will take him out of the experience and make him feel compelled to perform those tasks, not to do them for pleasure.

 + Excessive and unnecessary text:
Use only key concepts and avoid regressive concepts. You do not have to reveal everything to the player directly and do not put filler. You have to convey an idea clearly, concisely and with the right number of words.

 + Not taking into account the type of game you are doing:
Although it seems obvious, we must maintain the plot coherence of our game. Using external references from other games can be curious, but let's avoid using what is already created and let's focus on the key to what we are working on.


 + Quest balance and location:
Try the quests you do, think about the pacing (rhythm) of the game and whether or not it is convenient to place them in that place you have given them, or it is better that they appear at another time or another place or they should be eliminated directly.

 + Lack of variety:
Players hate the feeling of repetition, that everything is the same and that they only advance in the same way through different spaces. You have to inject variety and quality, rather than be guided by quantity. It doesn't matter how many things you can do if they don't convey anything new or different. 

## How to manage the process of quest creation
Although it is true that there are countless ways to make a correct design, today I will talk about the 8 steps to follow, from the book "The advance Narrative Toolbox" written by Tobias Heussner.
 
Obviously, everyone can modify the order of the steps, or delete and add as you see fit. Since this is a small guide taking into account the infinity of design possibilities.

Creativity is your only limit. 

### Step 1: Historical background 
![Image](/Assets/step_1.jpg)

Before we start with the design of a mission, we need to spend some time with the written and developed material that shapes our world, get to know it.
The reason for doing this is because we must ensure that our missions make sense within the world and that they are part of it. For this reason, the less worked and the less solid the "Lore" of this is, the more it will seem that the missions are put with a shoehorn. 

### Step 2: The hook
 
![Image](/Assets/step_2.jpg)

After spending some time on our background (and developing it further if necessary). That's when our mission hook comes into play.
Arouse curiosity and attract the player, since this is the essence of any narrative piece in which the mission is involved.

There is something that can help us, usually, if we can not summarize the idea we have for the mission, in one or two sentences, it means that we are not giving a clear idea and that it will probably confuse the player.

This part is more important than it seems at first sight, so if we give a clear idea of what is being developed it can be extremely useful to transmit our vision.

When developing a good hook, as a designer we must ask ourselves these questions, called core questions because they will help to form the central structure of this step and create a more solid hook. 

1. Why is this mission fun to play?

1. What makes it unique compared to the others?

1. What information will the player get about the story?

1. How “epic” is this mission?

1. What is the purpose of it?


Given the variety of missions and their context, it is not necessary that all questions be answered positively. But the higher the number, the more effective our hook will be. 

And as a little help, to finish understanding question 4, (How epic is this mission), here's a graph that shows the curve of interest at the different points over time in the game, only as an explanatory observation of what Tobías tries to tell us in his book.

### Step 3: General structure
![Image](/Assets/step_3.jpg)

In this step, is where we must begin to collect all the information that the chain of missions requires to be implemented correctly.
 
Because a mission can be part of a larger chain, this will depend on the form that we have given it.
 
For this step, a series of core questions are also given to help guiding the design.
 
1. How many missions are part of this chain? Is it the main one?
1. Where is it located?
1. What gaming regions are involved?
1. What NPCs / factions / guilds are involved?
1. What articles or items do I need?
1. Are there any special game mechanics required for this mission?
 
 
The answers to these questions can be decisive, because ultimately they give an idea of how complex the mission chain could become.In addition, answering these questions at this point helps to establish the limits for the actual design of the missions. within this chain of missions.
 
At the end of this step, it’s good to write a brief summary about the content, which makes this chain unique, that is, the missions that make it up as a whole and another brief paragraph about its plot to connect it in the background of the game thus converting it into a part more united to the world and its setting.


### Step 4: The Mission Chart
 ![Image](/Assets/step_4.jpg)

With all the general information at hand, we can begin to draw the quest chart, which shows how all the quests in the quest chain relate to each other. To distinguish the different missions from each other, in the document they recommend giving them a descriptive name or naming them with their concept or hook. 
 
### Recommendation: Articy Draft Tool
  ![Image](/Assets/articy_draft.jpg)

The way in which you mount your graphic is totally free, you can use post-its on a blackboard and join them with threads to the detective of the 50s, sketching on a paper or using a program created exclusively for this, I will let you know Articy: Draft. With this tool, you can design, join and rearrange your structure.
 
 
### Step 5: The map
  ![Image](/Assets/step_5.jpg)

After designing (or during the process of this) the mission graph, the map comes into play, drawing a map of the region, of the world that we have created, where the chain of missions will happen, to have a better visualization of how these influence .
 
The map is usually drawn as 'design art' and is far from everything the player will see in the later game (especially as regards missions), but it does help to get a better view of how the player will travel between the different locations while solving the quest chain.
 
In short, it is a tangible embodiment of the "hero's journey." So we should have a rough idea of how the player will travel through the region to solve the quest chain and how the visuals, acoustics, etc. will enrich this experience. 
 
### Reccomendation: Inkarnate Tool

Inkarnate is a very useful tool that can help us a lot when developing a map.
  ![Image](/Assets/inkarnate.gif)

It has a free version that offers functions such as the creation of continents, lakes, cities, routes, mountains and other settings that could even inspire you with new ideas and have to change the Lore. Because you should not be afraid to iterate, iteration is your best tool.

Its use is not very complex and it does something similar to other editors such as piskel or photoshop.

### Step 6: In-game information
  ![Image](/Assets/step_6.jpg)

So far, we've only discussed the general information in a more "conceptualized" way that is needed to design a mission or quest chain, more from a designer's rather than a player's perspective.

In this step, some of the things most necessary to create a real mission will be covered.

In the book this information is called "in-game information" because most (not all) of the texts in this step will be directly visible to the player in one way or another.

To begin this step, it is recommended to write a short summary that will be visible to the player.

The objective of the summary is that the players know in a matter of seconds what their current objectives are. For this text, it is good to be as short and precise as possible without breaking the imagination.

   ![Image](/Assets/words.png)


It is advisable to use clear verbs to describe the actions to be carried out. Perhaps the structure of Jo Kim can be to help you specify what words can benefit you.

### Step 7: Player's Information
   ![Image](/Assets/step_7.gif)
   _"Pokémon: Pearl and Diamond"_


In this step, all the texts and / or dialogues that are related to the mission are covered and will be made visible to the player during the mission.
 
Here you can feel free to write however you want, in prose, with riddles, direct, or whatever style you choose to create the atmosphere and tone that feels right for the context of the moment in the game during the point you are working on.
 
Generally, this is the most fun step to implement, you will be able to put your design to the test and test as you can unleash all your creative potential to create with words the scenes that you would like to share with the player.
 
This step in turn, consists of at least three different texts:
 
1. Description (the text that the players will read, before accepting the mission).
 
1. Text in progress (the text that will appear after accepting the mission or chain of missions, but before having solved it).
 
1. Report (the text that will be displayed when this has been completed and therefore the mission is resolved).
 
The first two texts are generally linked to the NPC (or character) who offers the mission, while the third can be given as a self-interpretation of the same person or being free.
 
### Step 8: Summary of the information
   ![Image](/Assets/step_8.jpg)

The last step in this design process is the creation of all the information, in the game, necessary for this specific mission.
 
This information block collects information such as when a mission is unlocked, who is the one who gives the mission, the closure condition (also known as the objective), etc. It also contains balancing information such as the target level range and what rewards female and male players will receive as soon as they have successfully solved the quest.
 
This is where most of the tweaking happens and where game balance is addressed to ensure that you stay within the flow channel and that the difficulty and skill level required correspond to each other.
 
You should approach it as a summary to consult to see more clearly the result of the iterations that you are doing, it is possible that the information does not vary much, but the fact that this summary exists could help you in cases in which the iterations have supposed big changes and you need to recapitulate to see the concept of the design that we previously had raised.
