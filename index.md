## Quests and Missions design


Hello,I’m Ismael Tejada, a student of the degree in Videogame Design and Development at the UPC through the CITM, and today I will explain a little about the design of these two points. The content of this web page has been developed as part of Project 2 of the second year subject, under the supervision of Ramon Santamaria. 

## What a mission is?

First of all I will define the word mission according to the Cambridge dictionary "a prolonged search for something that is difficult to find or an attempt to achieve something difficult." The clear definition of causality.

But ... how should they be approached from the point of view of a video game designer? And what do they mean for the players?

Well, we can say that mission design is part of the heart of our game, since it brings together 3 very important aspects, such as level design, the mechanics that are used and most importantly, the narrative.

Quoting Philippe Bergeron “Iterating the ideas of the designer alongside those of the writer. This is where most of the hours are spent for a good design "

That is why this part is of vital importance for game developers / designers since the player could forgive the graphics or certain mechanics, but not a repetitive and tedious narrative in a game in which the mechanics are 10 but the missions are the same over and over again creating repetitive routines in which the player ends up not spending time on them. 

When we talk about quests from a point of view closer to that of a player, it is when we see that our character has an objective to fulfill either because it is part of the story or because it has been entrusted to him.

There are many types of missions and of different importance. There are the main ones, which we normally associate with the story mode, some that have to do with the main narrative in a secondary way or not directly related.

But returning to the designer's point of view, it is remarkable that over time, both our video games and the way we see them have evolved.
At the same time, the missions have also followed the same path, with the appearance of new genres such as sandbox games, platforms, MMOs ... plus each genre is different, we cannot expect the same from all of them. With so many changes and so many possibilities, how do we know the best way to design our missions?

In this brief analysis I will provide you with different guidelines and tools that can help you. I will put several examples of good and bad praxis, obviously we will see games like Skyrim, the witcher 3 or wow in these comparisons. 


## Mission Types

If we look closely at the missions of all the games, we can see that there are a varied number of types among them.
I will talk about the following 4 types:

Murder
Looking for / giving someone / something
Gather Items
Escort someone

These are the types that most often abound in games. Surely a game with a mission within these 4 types is coming to mind. Although it is true that point 2 could be divided into search and delivery, I have decided to put them together given the similarities in terms of objectives, but we will go deeper later.

 But to quote James from extra-credits "Why are there almost 5 types of missions?" "Because many designers conceptualize their games as only combat or tour"

It is because many designers just try to turn them into combat or displacement and with those only two axes, the options are limited. They use them to "guide" the player to where they think he should go, as a way of teaching him to use that incredible charged attack he just learned, or to find the next important area.

The player is "forced" to do what we think is right, rather than letting him participate himself.
So .. Is this really a good structure to follow for our design?


## How to properly create a Quest

Lately the trend when developing video games is to try to make the player feel free and have the feeling of writing his own story, because the feeling of choosing gives them satisfaction, since they are not weighed down by a fixed script, at least not 100%. %.

The first step in creating a quest is to pose a problem to the player, but this must be attractive, first providing a call with a brushstroke of information, from a letter on a table that shines to a lady asking for help.
Whether this element is object or person, when it is interacted with the player, it must give the player an idea of what they are going to face, giving the player room to decide whether to accept the quest or not.

Advising the player and giving him an idea about what his actions can do, influences decision-making and will give him a better sense of immersion.

### How to guide the player, without him noticing

It is true that we want to convey a sense of freedom to the player, but at the same time we do not want him to lose himself, but we cannot take him by the hand and stop treating him as a rational being, so you have to find a balance.
The player will be guided based on the key concepts of the mission, an object to carry, a person to protect or a puzzle to solve. The clues that we want the player to follow must be "subtle" but findable and easy to follow once understood. Let the interest flow not only from the reward, but from the sense of adventure.

### Make your world alive.

Each quest must be given a background, a story, or a twist that makes it interesting and has a real reason for existence. You have to take a very important object to a site B, well, okay, but have it stolen in the middle of the road, or tried, or a strange being appears to help me complete the task and provide me with important information along the way. about where I am, or about an important subplot.

People love to be told stories and more if they are interesting. It does not matter if there is a choice, because there is no wrong decision, the important thing is that that story exists and that you do not feel that you are locked in a box, but that you are in an environment that lives and breathes by itself.


### Reinforce the main narrative and game pillars

When we create a quest and we want to weave a narrative, it must fit and reinforce some of the fundamental pillars of our game, so if magic or unicorns or aliens exist in our world, it will be normal for us to be told stories about invasions aliens, or how Fred once saw a unicorn and no one believed him and you must help him find it.

Briefly said, make everything in cohesion with the world that we have created for the player and help make the main argument more credible and important. 


## The 4X’s of Hayashida’s design

Koichi Hayashida, lead designer of the latest 3D Mario games, defined his work philosophy with 4 concepts that together strengthen the design of Nintendo games.

+ Explore the world:
Give the player the ability to move around the world to adopt a specific orientation of how to play

+ Expand the area to discover
Give the player a space to test what they learn without being penalized by failure, a safe testing environment where they can begin to master the mechanics.

+ Exploit the mechanics:
Once the player has mastered and internalized the mechanics, we must give importance to the decisions that the player makes when using the mechanics, leave him out of the safe space and face the danger so that he uses what he has learned against him.

+ Exterminate:
Pose a challenge that tests everything at once as part of the end of the process, if the player has learned well, he will be rewarded for his own learning and will want more. 


+ Quest vs Mission
Officially, according to the Cambridge Dictionary, a quest is "a long search for something that is difficult to find, or an attempt to achieve something difficult"

But well, what is the difference between what we call a quest in design and what is a mission?

We define a Quest as a difficult or greater objective, if we analyze it carefully from the point of view of video games. There are two main structures, one that follows the description and one that does not, this is where we see the difference.

For example, let's see the quest as a crusade that our protagonist faces, with a much more narrative central structure. Instead, the mission can be done more similar to a task, something that the protagonist must do, for example an NPC asks you to do something and consequently he rewards you. This can be seen involved in a Quest, being part of it or not. 

With this in mind, we could associate Quests with crusades and missions with something more like a task. 


## Guiding player’s attention

While designing a mission we have to take into account that we are creating an experience. For this we must take into account certain psychological factors that will help us create a better experience for our player.

This is where we will talk about how to properly capture his attention. 

This is why we must talk about some human and psychological behaviors that can help us create this content.

We will analyze from a point closer to our player.
What is it that makes our player interested in missions and have a desire for more?
One of our tasks as designers is to satisfy with quality experiences, but how do you make them want a new experience or how do you exploit those needs in a crafty way?

If our goal is to create a complete Quest, we may have some behavioral guidelines that most people follow.

**Illusion of power:**
Giving you the freedom to choose different options during the Quest can help us convey the feeling that the player is making relevant decisions. We will also get him to get more involved in the plot due to the consequences of his actions. thus creating a positive experience that facilitates the transmission of that illusion of power.

Since if you satisfy these three basic needs:

- Free will
- Deal with the consequences of your actions
- Situations close to reality.

This will provide a much more satisfying experience.

** Collectionism: **
This section is very important if you consider Achiever type players. Surely you are a connoisseur of video games that exploit the feature of completing collections, such as the kolog seeds in "Zelda Breath of The Wild" or the stars in "Mario Odyssey".

This takes advantage of one of the basic human instincts, inherited from our ancestors who walked while discovering and collecting new resources, a habit that over the years created this instinct to take or possess something.

The satisfaction that human beings feel when completing a collection, seeing all its parts together and feeling that it has been completed, is the satisfaction that we will take advantage of.

** The need to finish what was started: **
As a human being, it is not usually pleasant to leave things in the middle of the process, we usually feel the feeling of having to finish what we started. This takes advantage of the feeling of responsibility and the ego of our player.
