## Quests and Missions design


Hello,I’m Ismael Tejada, a student of the degree in Videogame Design and Development at the UPC through the CITM, and today I will explain a little about the design of these two points. The content of this web page has been developed as part of Project 2 of the second year subject, under the supervision of Ramon Santamaria.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/IsmaUPC/Quests/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
