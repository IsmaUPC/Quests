## Quests and Missions design


Hello,I’m Ismael Tejada, a student of the degree in Videogame Design and Development at the UPC through the CITM, and today I will explain a little about the design of these two points. The content of this web page has been developed as part of Project 2 of the second year subject, under the supervision of Ramon Santamaria. 

### What a mission is?

First of all I will define the word mission according to the Cambridge dictionary "a prolonged search for something that is difficult to find or an attempt to achieve something difficult." The clear definition of causality.

But ... how should they be approached from the point of view of a video game designer? And what do they mean for the players?

Well, we can say that mission design is part of the heart of our game, since it brings together 3 very important aspects, such as level design, the mechanics that are used and most importantly, the narrative.

Quoting Philippe Bergeron “Iterating the ideas of the designer alongside those of the writer. This is where most of the hours are spent for a good design "

That is why this part is of vital importance for game developers / designers since the player could forgive the graphics or certain mechanics, but not a repetitive and tedious narrative in a game in which the mechanics are 10 but the missions are the same over and over again creating repetitive routines in which the player ends up not spending time on them. 

When we talk about quests from a point of view closer to that of a player, it is when we see that our character has an objective to fulfill either because it is part of the story or because it has been entrusted to him.

There are many types of missions and of different importance. There are the main ones, which we normally associate with the story mode, some that have to do with the main narrative in a secondary way or not directly related.

But returning to the designer's point of view, it is remarkable that over time, both our video games and the way we see them have evolved.
At the same time, the missions have also followed the same path, with the appearance of new genres such as sandbox games, platforms, MMOs ... plus each genre is different, we cannot expect the same from all of them. With so many changes and so many possibilities, how do we know the best way to design our missions?

In this brief analysis I will provide you with different guidelines and tools that can help you. I will put several examples of good and bad praxis, obviously we will see games like Skyrim, the witcher 3 or wow in these comparisons. 


### Mission Types

If we look closely at the missions of all the games, we can see that there are a varied number of types among them.
I will talk about the following 4 types:

Murder
Looking for / giving someone / something
Gather Items
Escort someone

These are the types that most often abound in games. Surely a game with a mission within these 4 types is coming to mind. Although it is true that point 2 could be divided into search and delivery, I have decided to put them together given the similarities in terms of objectives, but we will go deeper later.

 But to quote James from extra-credits "Why are there almost 5 types of missions?" "Because many designers conceptualize their games as only combat or tour"

It is because many designers just try to turn them into combat or displacement and with those only two axes, the options are limited. They use them to "guide" the player to where they think he should go, as a way of teaching him to use that incredible charged attack he just learned, or to find the next important area.

The player is "forced" to do what we think is right, rather than letting him participate himself.
So .. Is this really a good structure to follow for our design?


## What quests are and how to create them properly

A quest is an errand, a small mission, outside of the usual tasks that has the function of providing experience to the player, making the world they inhabit more familiar and providing something less brainy than the main story as well as being a small branch of the preset narrative.

Lately the trend when developing video games is to try to make the player feel free and have the feeling of writing his own story, because the feeling of choosing gives them satisfaction, since they are not weighed down by a fixed script, at least not 100%. %.

The first step in creating a quest is to pose a problem to the player, but this must be attractive, first providing a call with a brushstroke of information, from a letter on a table that shines to a lady asking for help.
Whether this element is object or person, when it is interacted with the player, it must give the player an idea of ​​what they are going to face, giving the player room to decide whether to accept the quest or not.

Advising the player and giving him an idea about what his actions can do, influences decision-making and will give him a better sense of immersion.


## How to guide the player, without him noticing

It is true that we want to convey a sense of freedom to the player, but at the same time we do not want him to lose himself, but we cannot take him by the hand and stop treating him as a rational being, so you have to find a balance.
The player will be guided based on the key concepts of the mission, an object to carry, a person to protect or a puzzle to solve. The clues that we want the player to follow must be "subtle" but findable and easy to follow once understood. Let the interest flow not only from the reward, but from the sense of adventure.
